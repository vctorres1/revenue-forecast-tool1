EPP 1 – Diversify Homogeneous Forecast Results Tool
====================================================

Overview:
---------
This Streamlit app allows you to upload the forecast_results.csv file generated by the 
"EPP 1 Revenue Forecast Simulator" and reprocesses each deal plan to create more 
realistic, varied monthly deal combinations.

It also recalculates commissions (accounting for payout delay and 12-month spread),
re-evaluates total net profit, and helps identify:

- ✅ Qualified Plans (Net Profit ≥ $1,000,000)
- ⚠️ Near-Qualified Plans (Net Profit ≥ $800,000 but < $1,000,000)


How to Use:
-----------
1. Launch the app in Streamlit Cloud or locally using:
   > streamlit run diversify_forecast_results.py

2. Upload your forecast_results.csv file (from the original simulator).

3. Configure settings:
   - Adjust monthly expense values
   - Adjust profit targets (Qualified and Near-Qualified)

4. Wait for the app to reprocess the plans.
   It will:
   - Restructure homogenous monthly deal bundles into diverse combinations
   - Recalculate commission payout schedules
   - Compute updated total revenue and net profit

5. View:
   - Qualified Plans (meet or exceed your target)
   - Near-Qualified Plans (close to target)
   - Download results as CSV


Commission Rate Logic:
----------------------
The app assigns commission rates based on deal value:

- $2,000,000+ → 5%
- $1,000,000–$1,999,999 → 11%
- Below $1,000,000 → 17%

Each deal in a month is randomized to simulate real-world variation.


Technical Notes:
----------------
- Payouts are delayed by 2 months after a deal is closed.
- Each commission is spread equally over 12 months after the delay.
- Coaching revenue is counted as upfront income.
